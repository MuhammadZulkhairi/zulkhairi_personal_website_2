				<p><b>First of all, I would like to say Alhamdullillah and be grateful for being given the opportunity to complete an individual project that is to create a personal website. I would like to thank Sir Faizal Haini Bin Fadzil who has taught me a lot in this subject which is IMD 311, so that I managed to create my personal website successfully. Without him I might have had a hard time completing this individual project. In addition, thank you to my classmates who have given me a lot of support and assistance to complete this individual project. Not to forget my family members who gave a lot of support and words of encouragement and were always by my side when I faced difficult days.</b></p>
				<p><b>My name is Muhammad Zulkhairi Bin Mohd Jaafar. Currently, i'm studying at UiTM Machang in Faculty of Information Management and this is my last semester as a Information Management student. Talking about myself, I was raised in a modest family with my brother and sister. I am a person who loves to travel, eat, sports and even hiking. this is because I want to train myself so that every moment is filled with the best.</b></p>
				<p><b>During my school days, I was not an active student in any association or sport. but, after entering the university I joined the association and also became a pencak silat athlete there. it was a very good experience for me as it taught about discipline and also we were able to learn to manage the program.</b></p>
