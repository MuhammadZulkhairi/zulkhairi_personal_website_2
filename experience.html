            <p>I will tell you about my experience during my time at this university first. I am an athlete representing uitm machang in the tournament between UiTM which is "KARISMA". Being an athlete gives me a pretty good experience in disciplining myself. Among the achievements during my time as an athlete is that I won a gold medal for the Pahang Open and also won a silver medal for the "KARISMA" tournament.</p>
            
            <p><br>Besides that, among other experiences I was also the president of the pencak silat association at that time. I was given trust and confidence by the previous leadership in leading the next association leadership. this must have provided a very good opportunity for me to use it for the realm of work later on.</p>

            <p><br>Furthermore, among other experiences for me is outside I am a part -time insurance agent for prudential bsn takaful. I have been in the field for almost 3 years. this job taught me a lot in managing our time and the way we deal with people.</p>

            <p><br>Last but least, every experience I have had to this day has educated me a lot to be a better human being.</p>
